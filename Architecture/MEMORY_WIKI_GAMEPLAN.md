# Gameplan: Transitioning to the Persistent LLM Wiki Architecture

## The Problem
The current A.I.M. memory system is fractured. `core/MEMORY.md` is deprecated, stagnant, and the old 5-Tier Cascading Memory was removed. The Reincarnation loop successfully generates a clean session transcript (`archive/history/`), but the critical final step fails:
1. The transcript is passed to `session_summarizer.py`, which futilely tries to rewrite the deprecated `MEMORY.md`.
2. The transcript is *never* embedded/ingested into the `archive/project_core.db` for the Hybrid RAG search to use.
3. The LLM Wiki (Issue #264) was built but never initialized in the workspace, meaning there is no `memory-wiki/` directory to hold synthesized project lore.

## The Objective
We need to completely rip out the `MEMORY.md` dependency, initialize the Persistent LLM Wiki, and rewire the Reincarnation loop so that session logs are both vectorized (for RAG) and synthesized (for the Wiki).

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize the Persistent LLM Wiki
- **Action:** Create the `memory-wiki/` directory structure (`memory-wiki/_ingest/`, `memory-wiki/index.md`, `memory-wiki/log.md`).
- **Action:** Generate the `memory-wiki/WIKI_SCHEMA.md` system prompt so the Subconscious Daemon knows how to format the project lore.

### 2. Deprecate and Remove `core/MEMORY.md`
- **Action:** Delete `core/MEMORY.md`.
- **Action:** Remove any references to `core/MEMORY.md` from `GEMINI.md` and instruct the Conscious Agent to read `memory-wiki/index.md` instead.
- **Action:** Update the Conscious Agent's rules to drop new findings into `memory-wiki/_ingest/` rather than trying to edit memory directly.

### 3. Rewire the Reincarnation Pipeline (`handoff_pulse_generator.py`)
- **Action:** Modify `handoff_pulse_generator.py` so that when a session ends, it does TWO things with the clean flight recorder markdown:
  - **A. Vector Ingestion:** It automatically triggers an indexer to embed the markdown into `archive/project_core.db` so the Hybrid RAG search can find it later.
  - **B. Wiki Ingestion (The Drop Zone):** It drops a summary or the flight recorder itself into `memory-wiki/_ingest/` for the Subconscious Daemon to synthesize.

### 4. Obsidian Integration & The Dual-Search Architecture
The new system will operate on a "Dual-Search" architecture to maximize speed and semantic understanding:
- **Obsidian Native Sync:** The entire `memory-wiki/` directory is purely native Markdown. This means you can open the `memory-wiki/` folder directly as an Obsidian Vault. Any changes made by the Subconscious Daemon will instantly appear in your Obsidian knowledge graph.
- **Fast Lexical Search (`aim wiki search`):** We will keep the `wiki_tools.py` logic which builds an *in-memory* SQLite FTS5 database on the fly. This provides 0ms latency exact-keyword searches of the markdown files without needing to re-index them.
- **Deep Semantic Search (`aim search`):** To ensure the Conscious Agent can "feel" the architectural decisions via vector embeddings, the synthesized `memory-wiki/*.md` files MUST also be ingested into the `archive/project_core.db` vector store. We will update the background indexer to scan the `memory-wiki/` directory alongside the `archive/history/` directory.
- **Action:** Rip out the monolithic logic that tries to rewrite `MEMORY.md`.
- **Action:** Convert it into a clean pipeline trigger that:
  1. Embeds the raw history into `project_core.db`.
  2. Drops a synthesized "Signal Skeleton" into `memory-wiki/_ingest/`.
  3. Executes `aim wiki process` (or pings the daemon webhook) to have the secondary LLM synthesize the new lore into the `memory-wiki/` markdown files.

### 5. Manual & Automatic Triggers
- **Action:** Ensure `aim wiki process` works flawlessly when called manually via the CLI (for when the user drops PDFs or notes into `_ingest/`).
- **Action:** Ensure it fires automatically at the very end of the `/reincarnate` sequence.

## The End State
When you run `/reincarnate`:
1. The dying agent generates a clean Markdown log of the session.
2. That log is mathematically embedded into the LanceDB RAG 5.21 system for instant Hybrid RAG search retrieval.
3. The core takeaways are dropped into `memory-wiki/_ingest/`.
4. A background (Subconscious) LLM wakes up, reads the ingest folder, updates `memory-wiki/index.md` with the new lore, and goes back to sleep.
5. The new agent wakes up with perfect, zero-latency access to both the raw vector history and the highly synthesized Wiki lore.
